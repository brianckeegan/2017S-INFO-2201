    "\n",
    "Insertion sort is a $O(N^2)$ algorithm in the worst case, but it has a nice balance of being readable but potentially much faster than other $O(N^2)$-class sorting algorithms in the best case. [Miller & Ranum](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/SortSearch/TheInsertionSort.html) describe the general idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"We begin by assuming that a list with one item (position 0) is already sorted. On each pass, one for each item 1 through $nâˆ’1$, the current item is checked against those in the already sorted sublist. As we look back into the already sorted sublist, we shift those items that are greater to the right. When we reach a smaller item or the end of the sublist, the current item can be inserted.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "![Insertion sort](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/_images/insertionsort.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to think about insertion sort is there's a boundary where everything to the left of the boundary we *know* is sorted and everything to the right of the boundary still needs to be sorted. So the general idea is to keep moving the boundary to the right (until we get to the end of the list) by sorting each item just to the right of the boundary into the left-hand side. The actual sorting of the left-hand side works by checking each element in the left to see if it's greater that what needs to be sorted: if it's greater, slide it to the right and if it's less, you're in the right spot to insert the new value.\n",
