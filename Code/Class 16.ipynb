    "# Class 16: Reinforcing data structures with unique elements\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous class provided an introduction into how to work with sets and dictionaries by constructing, accessing, and mutating these objects. We also looked at some real world examples in terms of how APIs like Twitter's returns structured meta-data in the form of dictionaries. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries have some nice performance $O(1)$ properties for accessing and mutating data compared to lists. In this class, we'll explore how dictionaries and sets take advantage of [hash functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) to achieve these high levels of performance. Hashing also has [applications for cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) to secure data by making it difficult for un-authenticated users to access data or alternatively make it obvious if someone altered the data. \n",

    "## Hashing functions\n",
    "A hash function takes an input of some variable length and converts it to a fixed length sequence. Hashing has the property of calculating the hashed value of an input is extremely fast but trying to reverse from a hash back to the input is enormously expensive. This makes them great for cryptography where you want to easily encode information while making it difficult to decode. \n",
    "\n",
    "The value it puts out can be called a hash, message digest, hash value, or checksum. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most hash functions should produce unique outputs for a given input, but in some cases *collisions* can occur where two different inputs result in the same hash value. Understanding why this happens requires diving deeper into the mathematical theory of hashing functions, but we'll simply assert that hashing functions should always return a unique hash value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vanilla Python has a [`hash`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#hash) function we can call without importing anything as well as a [`hashlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html#) that implements more complicated approaches. In Python 3.3 and up, the hash of the same object like `hash('a')` will differ based on a randomized seed from the start of each session. This is primarily for security."

This usually involves using database techniques such as [[spatial index|spatial indices]]. These patterns can then be seen as a kind of summary of the input data, and may be used in further analysis or, for example, in machine learning and [[predictive analytics]]. For example, the data mining step might identify multiple groups in the data, which can then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a [[decision support system]]. Neither the data collection, data preparation, nor result interpretation and reporting is part of the data mining step, but do belong to the overall KDD process as additional steps.\\n\\nThe related terms \\'\\'[[data dredging]]\\'\\', \\'\\'data fishing\\'\\', and \\'\\'data snooping\\'\\' refer to the use of data mining methods to sample parts of a larger population data set that are (or may be) too small for reliable statistical inferences to be made about the validity of any patterns discovered. These methods can, however, be used in creating new hypotheses to test against the larger data populations.\\n\\n==Etymology==\\nIn the 1960s, statisticians used terms like \"Data Fishing\" or \"Data Dredging\" to refer to what they considered the bad practice of analyzing data without an a-priori hypothesis. The term \"Data Mining\" appeared around 1990 in the database community. For a short time in 1980s, a phrase \"database mining\"™, was used, but since it was trademarked by HNC, a San Diego-based company, to pitch their Database Mining Workstation;<ref name=\"Mena\">{{cite book |last=Mena |first=Jesús |year=2011 |title=Machine Learning Forensics for Law Enforcement, Security, and Intelligence |location=Boca Raton, FL |publisher=CRC Press (Taylor & Francis Group) |isbn=978-1-4398-6069-4 }}</ref> researchers consequently turned to \"data mining\". Other terms used include Data Archaeology, Information Harvesting, Information Discovery, Knowledge Extraction, etc. [[Gregory I. Piatetsky-Shapiro|Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro]] coined the term \"Knowledge Discovery in Databases\" for the first workshop on the same topic [http://www.kdnuggets.com/meetings/kdd89/ (KDD-1989)] and this term became more popular in AI and Machine Learning Community.

It was co-chaired by [[Usama Fayyad]] and Ramasamy Uthurusamy.  A year later, in 1996,  [[Usama Fayyad]] launched the journal by Kluwer called [[Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery]] as its founding Editor-in-Chief.

The Journal Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery is the primary research journal of the field.\\n\\n==Background==\\nThe manual extraction of patterns from [[data]] has occurred for centuries. Early methods of identifying patterns in data include [[Bayes\\' theorem]] (1700s) and [[regression analysis]] (1800s). The proliferation, ubiquity and increasing power of computer technology has dramatically increased data collection, storage, and manipulation ability. As [[data set]]s have grown in size and complexity, direct \"hands-on\" data analysis has increasingly been augmented with indirect, automated data processing, aided by other discoveries in computer science, such as [[neural networks]], [[cluster analysis]], [[genetic algorithms]] (1950s), [[decision tree learning|decision trees]] and [[decision rules]] (1960s), and [[support vector machines]] (1990s). Data mining is the process of applying these methods with the intention of uncovering hidden patterns<ref name=\"Kantardzic\">{{cite book |last=Kantardzic |first=Mehmed |title=Data Mining: Concepts, Models, Methods, and Algorithms |year=2003 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=0-471-22852-4 |oclc=50055336 }}</ref> in large data sets. It bridges the gap from [[applied statistics]] and artificial intelligence (which usually provide the mathematical background) to [[database management]] by exploiting the way data is stored and indexed in databases to execute the actual learning and discovery algorithms more efficiently, allowing such methods to be applied to ever larger data sets.\\n\\n==Process==\\nThe \\'\\'\\'Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process\\'\\'\\' is commonly defined with the stages:\\n\\n:(1) Selection\\n:(2) Pre-processing\\n:(3) Transformation\\n:(4) \\'\\'Data Mining\\'\\'\\n:(5) Interpretation/Evaluation.<ref name=\"Fayyad\" />\\n\\nIt exists, however, in many variations on this theme, such as the [[Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining]] (CRISP-DM) which defines six phases:\\n\\n:(1) Business Understanding\\n:(2) Data Understanding\\n:(3) Data Preparation\\n:(4) Modeling\\n:(5) Evaluation\\n:(6) Deployment\\n\\nor a simplified process such as (1) pre-processing, (2) data mining, and (3) results validation.\\n\\nPolls conducted in 2002, 2004, 2007 and 2014 show that the CRISP-DM methodology is the leading methodology used by data miners.<ref>[[Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro]] (2002) [http://www.kdnuggets.com/polls/2002/methodology.htm \\'\\'KDnuggets Methodology Poll\\'\\'], [[Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro]] (2004) [http://www.kdnuggets.com/polls/2004/data_mining_methodology.htm \\'\\'KDnuggets Methodology Poll\\'\\'], [[Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro]] (2007) [http://www.kdnuggets.com/polls/2007/data_mining_methodology.htm \\'\\'KDnuggets Methodology Poll\\'\\'], [[Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro]] (2014) [http://www.kdnuggets.com/polls/2014/analytics-data-mining-data-science-methodology.html \\'\\'KDnuggets Methodology Poll\\'\\']</ref> The only other data mining standard named in these polls was [[SEMMA]].

As data mining can only uncover patterns actually present in the data, the target data set must be large enough to contain these patterns while remaining concise enough to be mined within an acceptable time limit. A common source for data is a [[data mart]] or [[data warehouse]]. Pre-processing is essential to analyze the [[Multivariate statistics|multivariate]] data sets before data mining. The target set is then cleaned. Data cleaning removes the observations containing [[statistical noise|noise]] and those with [[missing data]].\\n\\n===Data mining===\\nData mining involves six common classes of tasks:<ref name=\"Fayyad\">{{cite web |last1=Fayyad |first1=Usama |authorlink1=Usama Fayyad |last2=Piatetsky-Shapiro |first2=Gregory|authorlink2=Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro |last3=Smyth |first3=Padhraic |title=From Data Mining to Knowledge Discovery in Databases |year=1996 |url=http://www.kdnuggets.com/gpspubs/aimag-kdd-overview-1996-Fayyad.pdf |accessdate = 17 December 2008 }}</ref>\\n\\n* [[Anomaly detection]] (Outlier/change/deviation detection) – The identification of unusual data records, that might be interesting or data errors that require further investigation.\\n* [[Association rule learning]] (Dependency modelling) – Searches for relationships between variables. For example, a supermarket might gather data on customer purchasing habits. Using association rule learning, the supermarket can determine which products are frequently bought together and use this information for marketing purposes. This is sometimes referred to as market basket analysis.\\n* [[Cluster analysis|Clustering]] – is the task of discovering groups and structures in the data that are in some way or another \"similar\", without using known structures in the data.\\n* [[Statistical classification|Classification]] – is the task of generalizing known structure to apply to new data. For example, an e-mail program might attempt to classify an e-mail as \"legitimate\" or as \"spam\".\\n* [[Regression analysis|Regression]] – attempts to find a function which models the data with the least error.\\n* [[Automatic summarization|Summarization]] – providing a more compact representation of the data set, including visualization and report generation.\\n\\n===Results validation===\\n[[File:Spurious correlations - spelling bee spiders.svg|thumb|An example of data produced by [[data dredging]] through a bot operated by statistician Tyler Vigen, apparently showing a close link between the best word winning a spelling bee competition and the number of people in the United States killed by venomous spiders. The similarity in trends is obviously a coincidence.]]\\nData mining can unintentionally be misused, and can then produce results which appear to be significant; but which do not actually predict future behaviour and cannot be [[Reproducibility|reproduced]] on a new sample of data and bear little use. Often this results from investigating too many hypotheses and not performing proper [[statistical hypothesis testing]]. A simple version of this problem in [[machine learning]] is known as [[overfitting]], but the same problem can arise at different phases of the process and thus a train/test split - when applicable at all - may not be sufficient to prevent this from happening.<ref name=hawkins>{{cite journal | last1 = Hawkins | first1 = Douglas M | year = 2004 | title = The problem of overfitting | url = | journal = Journal of chemical information and computer sciences | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 1–12 | doi=10.1021/ci0342472}}</ref>\\n\\n{{Missing information|section|non-classification tasks in data mining. It only covers [[machine learning]]|date=September 2011}}\\nThe final step of knowledge discovery from data is to verify that the patterns produced by the data mining algorithms occur in the wider data set. Not all patterns found by the data mining algorithms are necessarily valid. It is common for the data mining algorithms to find patterns in the training set which are not present in the general data set. This is called [[overfitting]]. To overcome this, the evaluation uses a [[test set]] of data on which the data mining algorithm was not trained. The learned patterns are applied to this test set, and the resulting output is compared to the desired output. For example, a data mining algorithm trying to distinguish \"spam\" from \"legitimate\" emails would be trained on a [[training set]] of sample e-mails. Once trained, the learned patterns would be applied to the test set of e-mails on which it had \\'\\'not\\'\\' been trained. The accuracy of the patterns can then be measured from how many e-mails they correctly classify. A number of statistical methods may be used to evaluate the algorithm, such as [[Receiver operating characteristic|ROC curves]].\\n\\nIf the learned patterns do not meet the desired standards, subsequently it is necessary to re-evaluate and change the pre-processing and data mining steps. If the learned patterns do meet the desired standards, then the final step is to interpret the learned patterns and turn them into knowledge.\\n\\n==Research==\\nThe premier professional body in the field is the [[Association for Computing Machinery]]\\'s (ACM) Special Interest Group (SIG) on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining ([[SIGKDD]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://academic.research.microsoft.com/?SearchDomain=2&SubDomain=7&entitytype=2|title=Microsoft Academic Search: Top conferences in data mining | publisher=[[Microsoft Academic Search]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://scholar.google.de/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_datamininganalysis|title=Google Scholar: Top publications - Data Mining & Analysis|publisher=[[Google Scholar]]}}</ref> Since 1989 this ACM SIG has hosted an annual international conference and published its proceedings,<ref>[http://www.kdd.org/conferences.php Proceedings], International Conferences on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, ACM, New York.</ref> and since 1999 it has published a biannual [[academic journal]] titled \"SIGKDD Explorations\".<ref>[http://www.kdd.org/explorations/about.php SIGKDD Explorations], ACM, New York.</ref>\\n\\nComputer science conferences on data mining include:\\n\\n* [[CIKM Conference]] – ACM [[Conference on Information and Knowledge Management]]\\n* [[DMIN Conference]] – International Conference on Data Mining\\n* [[DMKD Conference]] – Research Issues on Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery\\n* [[DSAA Conference]] – IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics\\n* [[ECDM Conference]] – European Conference on Data Mining\\n* [[ECML-PKDD Conference]] – [[European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases]]\\n* [[EDM Conference]] – International Conference on Educational Data Mining\\n* [[INFOCOM Conference]] – IEEE INFOCOM\\n* [[ICDM Conference]] – [[IEEE]] [[International Conference on Data Mining]]\\n* [[KDD Conference]] – ACM SIGKDD [[Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining]]\\n* [[MLDM Conference]] – Machine Learning and Data Mining in Pattern Recognition\\n* [[PAKDD Conference]] – The annual [[Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining]]\\n* [[PAW Conference]] – Predictive Analytics World\\n* [[SDM Conference]] – [[SIAM International Conference on Data Mining]] ([[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics|SIAM]])\\n* [[SSTD Symposium]] – [[Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases]]\\n* [[WSDM Conference]] – ACM [[Conference on Web Search and Data Mining]]\\n\\nData mining topics are also present on many [[List of computer science conferences#Data Management|data management/database conferences]] such as the [[ICDE Conference]], [[SIGMOD|SIGMOD Conference]] and [[International Conference on Very Large Data Bases]]\\n\\n==Standards==\\nThere have been some efforts to define standards for the data mining process, for example the 1999 European [[Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining]] (CRISP-DM 1.0) and the 2004 [[Java Data Mining]] standard (JDM 1.0). Development on successors to these processes (CRISP-DM 2.0 and JDM 2.0) was active in 2006, but has stalled since. JDM 2.0 was withdrawn without reaching a final draft.\\n\\nFor exchanging the extracted models – in particular for use in [[predictive analytics]]&nbsp;– the key standard is the [[Predictive Model Markup Language]] (PMML), which is an [[XML]]-based language developed by the Data Mining Group (DMG) and supported as exchange format by many data mining applications. As the name suggests, it only covers prediction models, a particular data mining task of high importance to business applications. However, extensions to cover (for example) [[subspace clustering]] have been proposed independently of the DMG.<ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Günnemann | first1 = Stephan | last2 = Kremer | first2 = Hardy | last3 = Seidl | first3 = Thomas | doi = 10.1145/2023598.2023605 | chapter = An extension of the PMML standard to subspace clustering models | title = Proceedings of the 2011 workshop on Predictive markup language modeling - PMML \\'11 | pages = 48 | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-1-4503-0837-3 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref>\\n\\n==Notable uses==\\n{{Main article|Examples of data mining}}\\n{{Category see also|Applied data mining}}\\n\\nData mining is used wherever there is digital data available today.

A common way for this to occur is through [[aggregate function|data aggregation]]. Data aggregation involves combining data together (possibly from various sources) in a way that facilitates analysis (but that also might make identification of private, individual-level data deducible or otherwise apparent).<ref name=\"NASCIO\">[http://www.nascio.org/publications/documents/NASCIO-dataMining.pdf \\'\\'Think Before You Dig: Privacy Implications of Data Mining & Aggregation\\'\\'], NASCIO Research Brief, September 2004</ref> This is not data mining \\'\\'per se\\'\\', but a result of the preparation of data before – and for the purposes of – the analysis.

According to an article in \\'\\'Biotech Business Week\\', \"\\'[i]n practice, HIPAA may not offer any greater protection than the longstanding regulations in the research arena,\\' says the AAHC.
